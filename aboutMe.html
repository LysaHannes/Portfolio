			Hi, I am a full time fifth year Co-op Computer Science and Busines Honors student at Brock University. I am really interested in app development, web development and web design!
			I am also interested in video games, and I think it would be a really great expierience to be involved in game development. 
			I also would like to try to be an ethical hacker. And I think that owning my own business would be a great experience as well. 
			In general I am trying to broaden my horizons in the computer science world. There are so many things I want to learn about and experience!
			I am a also a big animal person (as you could tell from my home page).
