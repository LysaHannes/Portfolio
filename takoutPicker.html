    <h2>Overview</h2>
        <article>
            <section>
                I thought I would work on a small project for myself while job searching. 
                I sometimes have trouble picking where I want to go out to eat so I decided to make a simple webapp using the mern stack to help me out. It will be mobile based cus thats where im going to use this webapp, but I will be making the app responsive.</br>

                </br>

                Im hoping this project will help display my skills as a software engineer/developer.</br>

                </br>

                Here are the curent phases of the development process I have covered so far.</br>
                - Planning</br>
                - Design</br>

    <h2>Planning</h2>
    <article>
        <section>
           Figma is a good tool that I have experience using in my other projects and is well known to be used for the planning and deign process of software development, so I decided to use that.
        
            This was my initial plan/outline for what I wanted the app to be/have. As I wemt through the design process found I had to add couple more pages.

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/takeoutPickerPlan.jpg" alt="plan" width="700px" class = "center"/>
            </div>

        </section>
    </article>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <article>
        <section>
           I am currently still working on the design/layout for the app. But here is what I have so far. (Designs created using Figma) </br> </br>
           <div style="text-align: center;">
            Login Page: </br>
            This will be the defult page if you arent logged in. 
           </div>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/takeoutPickerLogin.jpg" alt="plan" width="400px" class = "center"/>
            </div></br>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                Sign Up Page: </br>
                This will be the page the comes up is you click sign up on the login page.
            </div>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/takeoutPickerSignUp.jpg" alt="plan" width="400px" class = "center"/>
            </div></br>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                Verification Page: </br>
                This will be the page the comes up when signing up or loggin as a 2 factor authentication to ensure security.</br> (The text on the button will be deffernt depending on whether your logging in or signing up)
            </div>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/takeoutPickerVerify.jpg" alt="plan" width="400px" class = "center"/>
            </div></br>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                Home Page: </br>
                This will be the page the comes up when you log in. when you click the button it will pick a location from your list of locations.</br>
                Additionally the Menu will be acessible from anywhere once logged in. </br>
                Im thinking of adding a page for browsing locations to add to your list.</br></br>
                Later on I might add pages for Tutorials, About the App, and Making a Donation. But not now cus they are not important for the functionality of the app.
            </div>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/takeoutPickerHome.jpg" alt="plan" width="400px" class = "center"/>
            </div></br>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                Profile Page: </br>
                This will be the page shows your profile, how many followers you have and the location you have on your list.</br>
                If your looking at your own profile, you can delete your locations here.</br>
                If your looking at someone elses profile, then you can save one of thier locations to add to your list.</br></br>
                Maybe I will make it so it will show how many people have saved it, and the creator of the location. But I will figure that out when I design the database.
            </div>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/takeoutPickerProfile.jpg" alt="plan" width="400px" class = "center"/>
            </div></br>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                Friends List Page: </br>
                This will be the page shows your friends (only you can see this).
            </div>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/takeoutPickerFriends.jpg" alt="plan" width="400px" class = "center"/>
            </div></br>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
            Next Pages: </br>
                - Add New location</br>
                - Settings</br>
                - Location was picked</br>
            </div>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
