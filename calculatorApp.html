    <h2>Overview</h2>
        <article>
            <section>
            I used Android studio to create this app. The professor said every calculator app he has ever looked over has had some sort of problem. 
            So I made it my goal to make this app perfect with no flaws. I went through vigorous testing to ensure it was perfect and I succeeded achieving 100% for my final grade. 
            <br></br>
            When creating my app, I decided to make my own combination of the Apple Calculator App and the Android Calculator App, combining my favorite details from both.
            <br></br>
            The one error I know exists and I didn't know how to fix is overfilling the textView with numbers. 
            Also when my screen is rotated it doesn't save the calculation for some reason even though I set the id.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Here are all the edge cases that I covered (as far as I can remember) and how I handled them:
            
            <ul>
                <li>When clicking a number(not including 0) :
                    <ul>
                        <li>if the "=" button was just pressed
                            <ul>
                                <li>then the number pressed replaces the calculation</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>   
                        <li>if there have been numbers input, and the user didn't type "0" after a decimal
                            <ul>
                                <li>then we remove the last char of the number and replace it with the clicked number</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li> 
                        <li>if there have been numbers input, and the only number on the screen is 0(even if the user input 0)
                            <ul>
                                <li>then we remove the last char of the number and replace it with the clicked number</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li> 
                    </ul>
                </br>
                <li>When clicking an operator :
                    <ul>
                        <li>if an operator was the last thing input
                            <ul>
                                <li>then the new operator replaces the old one</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li> 
                        <li>if no numbers have been input before the operator</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>then it tells you that you can't do that</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li> 
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </br>
                <li>When clicking "0":
                    <ul>
                        <li>if the "=" button was just pressed
                            <ul>
                                <li>then the number pressed replaces the calculation</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>0 cannot be placed after an operator
                            <ul>
                                <li>(otherwise I had a problem where I could input 00003 for example)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>if there have been numbers input, and the user didn't type "0" after a decimal
                            <ul>
                                <li>then we remove the last char of the number and replace it with the clicked number</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>if there have been numbers input, and the only number on the screen is 0 (even if the user input 0)
                            <ul>
                                <li>then we remove the last char of the number and replace it with the clicked number</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>if 0 is the first number
                            <ul>
                                <li>other numbers being clicked replace</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </br>
                <li>When clicking "=":
                    <ul>
                        <li>if the user clicks "=" when nothing has been input
                            <ul>
                                <li>nothing happens</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>if an operator was the last thing input
                            <ul>
                                <li>then an error message pops up</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </br>
                <li>When clicking ".":
                    <ul>
                        <li>if the ArrayList "numbers" is empty
                            <ul>
                                <li>then it makes the first value 0.0</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>if the last element was an operator
                            <ul>
                                <li>it adds 0.0 for the next number</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>if the last number already has a decimal
                            <ul>
                                <li>then it sends an error message</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </br>
                <li>When clicking "C":
                    <ul>
                        <li>if nothing is input
                            <ul>
                                <li>nothing happens</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>otherwise removes digits, one digit at a time</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            (Brackets, S and R buttons don't work cus I didn't need them, and I didn't have time left to finish implementing them, so they are incomplete.)
