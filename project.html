<h2>Overview</h2>
	<article>
		<section>
		<P>This animation shows a couple of balls that appear to be playfully dancing around to the tune of “He’s a Pirate” from The Pirates of the Caribbean, 
		playing the song on the piano. This write up will go over my process for the creation of this animation. 
		I will mention all of the YouTube videos I used in the write up, andI will also provide a list with links at the end.

<h2>Learning</h2>
	<article>
		<section>
			<P>I decided that before I even start to create the animation I would need to learn how to use Blender’s tools to effectively animate, 
			since I had not used Blender before. To do so I started by looking into some YouTube videos, one that caught my eye was “Animation for Beginners! 
			(Blender Tutorial)” by Ryan King Art. This video showed how to animate a cube bouncing and looking around. 
			While following the tutorial I learned about how to use keyframes effectively in Blender, as well as how to rotate, translate and scale objects in Blender.

			<P>After learning the basics of animation I then decided that I would learn how to make my own models. I once again went to YouTube and found another tutorial; 
			“Tutorial: Blender MODELLING For Absolute Beginners | Low Poly Girl” by PIXXO 3D. This video taught me how to use the various tools that Blender has for 
			creating 3D models. First if you have a reference photo to use, you add the reference picture into the blender file, so you can see different angles of what 
			you want to model. Then you should start with a blender cube, then go into edit mode, here is where you can find all the different tools that blender has for
			modeling. The tools that I used for my model were Extrude Region, Bevel, and Loop Cut. I will talk more about these and how I used them in the next section.
